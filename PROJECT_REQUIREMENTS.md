## User Stories

### Epic 1: Initial Setup
**US-001**: As a new user, I want to be guided through the model download process so that I can start using the AI chatbot.

**US-002**: As a user, I want to see download progress so that I know how long the setup will take.

**US-003**: As a user, I want the app to handle network issues during download so that I don't lose progress.

### Epic 2: Chat Functionality
**US-004**: As a user, I want to have natural text conversations with the AI so that I can get helpful responses.

**US-005**: As a user, I want to share images with the AI so that I can get insights about visual content.

**US-006**: As a user, I want to see my conversation history so that I can reference previous interactions.

### Epic 3: App Management
**US-007**: As a user, I want to clear my conversation history so that I can maintain privacy.

**US-008**: As a user, I want to see app settings and model information so that I can understand system status.

## Technical Architecture

### High-Level Components
1. **Model Manager**: Handles download, initialization, and lifecycle of Gemma model
2. **Chat Engine**: Manages conversation flow and AI inference
3. **UI Layer**: Flutter widgets for chat interface and user interactions
4. **Storage Layer**: Local persistence for conversations and app data
5. **Image Processor**: Handles image input preparation for multimodal queries

### Data Flow
1. User input (text/image) → Input Processor
2. Input Processor → Gemma Model (via flutter_gemma plugin)
3. Model Response → Response Formatter
4. Formatted Response → UI Update
5. Conversation → Local Storage
